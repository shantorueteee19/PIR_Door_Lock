# PIR_Door_Lock
It is a project based on Arduino.
Basically in this project, a PIR sensor will detect movement and while detecting movement it will send a logic HIGH to the servo motor and the buzzer and servo will
be rotating and the door will be connected to servo motor, therefore the door will be opened. After few seconds it will be automatically restore the servo to its 
initial position. This is how it does work.
